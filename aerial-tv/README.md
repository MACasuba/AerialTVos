# aerial

Aerial is a viewer for the Apple TV's Aerial screensavers that lets you choose which screensaver you want to view. It dynamically updates the list of videos from Apple's servers. All videos are streamed on-the-fly, so disk usage is minimal.

## Instructions
Build and run the project in the xcode folder on your Apple TV. It's as easy as that!

If you want to modify the TVJS or TVML, you'll have to host the client folder locally or on the internet. Make sure to change the URL in AppDelegate.swift.

## TODO
If you can help with any of these, please feel free to submit a pull request.

- Add video screenshots to each playlist as artwork
- Make playlists loop
- Add alert dialogs to error handlers
