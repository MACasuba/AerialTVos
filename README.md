# AerialTVos
Aerial video listing preview on Apple TV 4


This code is based on the Aerial project by Jesse Friedman aka okofish
https://github.com/okofish/aerial

It is a working code for TVos 10.1

This to see if images could be added to the overview of aerials
I found this page : https://swift.unicorn.tv/screencasts/introduction-to-tvos

I could not find the metadata in the .MOV files for thumbnails, so I have created screenshot images (when new videos are added by Apple, they won't update automatically)
