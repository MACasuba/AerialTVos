# AerialTVos
Aerial video listing preview on Apple TV 4


This code is based on the Aerial project by Jesse Friedman aka okofish
https://github.com/okofish/aerial

It is a working code for TVos 10.1

This to see if images could be added to the overview of aerials
I found this page : https://swift.unicorn.tv/screencasts/introduction-to-tvos

Due to lack of .js knowledge ;

1. The Apple aerials are in nested arrays, I don't know how to extract them from http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json

2. the thumbnails can be extracted in .js code , but i don't know how to do it (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36883037/generate-a-thumbnail-snapshot-of-a-video-file-selected-by-a-file-input-at-a-spec)

3. the number of Day and number of night Aerials should be corrected on the two buttons to filter the results
